# Data Wrangling Exersises

commit is used to make a checkpoint on the local group (computer)
use push to link local files with github

pull often to stay up to date with your group members 

# Avocado Data Wrangling 
first need to load the tidyverse library
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

avocado<-read_csv("avocado.csv")

avocado<-avocado%>%clean_names()

avocado%>%head()

```

We use `arrange()` for sorting variables

```{r}

avocado%>%
  arrange(average_price)%>%
  head()

```

let's change the order
```{r}

avocado%>%
  arrange(desc(average_price))%>%
  head()

```

let's `select()`

```{r}
dim(avocado)

avocado_short<-avocado%>%
  select(date, average_price, total_volume)
```
